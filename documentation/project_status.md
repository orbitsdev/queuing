# Kiosqueeing System - Current Project Status

## Executive Summary

The Kiosqueeing system is a comprehensive queue management solution built with Laravel 12, Livewire 3, and Wire UI.

## Technical Foundation

- **Framework**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: Livewire 3 + Wire UI

- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Authentication**: Laravel's built-in auth with role-based permissions
- **Real-time Updates**: Livewire's real-time capabilities

## Ready for Kiosk Implementation

The system is now ready for kiosk implementation. The existing test route (`/create-test-queue/{branch?}/{service?}`) provides a foundation for the kiosk functionality, which will allow customers to:

1. Select a service
2. Generate a queue ticket
3. Receive a printed or digital ticket with their queue number

The kiosk module will be the final component to complete the end-to-end queue management system.

## Next Steps

1. **Kiosk Interface Development**:
   - Create a touchscreen-friendly interface for service selection
   - Implement ticket generation and printing functionality
   - Design a visually appealing and intuitive user flow

2. **API Development**:
   - Expand the existing ApiResponse helper for consistent API responses
   - Create endpoints for kiosk-to-server communication
   - Implement security measures for public-facing API

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete flow from ticket generation to counter service
   - Verify real-time updates across all interfaces
   - Ensure proper queue number generation and display

4. **Deployment Planning**:
   - Hardware requirements for kiosks and display monitors
   - Network configuration for multi-branch deployment
   - Training materials for staff and administrators
