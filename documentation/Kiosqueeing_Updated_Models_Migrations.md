### üîπ Queues

| Field | Data Type | Purpose | Constraints |
|-------|------------|---------|--------------|
| id | INT (PK) | Unique ticket ID | Auto Increment |
| branch_id | INT (FK) | Link to Branch | Required |
| service_id | INT (FK) | Link to Service | Required |
| counter_id | INT (FK) | Assigned counter | Nullable |
| user_id | INT (FK) | Staff handling ticket | Nullable |
| ticket_number | VARCHAR | Printed ticket number | Indexed |
| status | ENUM | waiting, called, serving, held, completed, skipped, expired, cancelled | Required |

- `max_hold_time_minutes` = `5`

---

## ‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Migration Plan

- One migration per table.
- Foreign keys enforce integrity.
- Indexes on `ticket_number`, `status`, `service_id`, `counter_id`.
- Enum constraints for `status` and `role`.
- Daily reset with `queue:reset` Artisan command.

## ‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Scenarios



## ‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Example Scenario

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Customer Arrival:**  
   Maria arrives at City Hall. She uses the kiosk to select `Cashier Payment`.  
   The system generates ticket `C101` with status `waiting`. Maria waits in the lobby.

2. **Counter Staff:**  
   Cashier 1 finishes serving and opens the dashboard.  
   They see all `waiting` tickets for Cashier Service.  
   They manually pick `C101`. The system updates status to `called` and assigns `Counter 1`.

3. **Service:**  
   Maria goes to Counter 1. Staff completes the payment. They click `Serve` ‚Üí status becomes `served`.

4. **Hold/Skip:**  
   If Maria forgot a document, staff clicks `Hold` ‚Üí status `held`.  
   When she returns, staff clicks `Resume` ‚Üí status back to `called`.  
   If Maria never returns, staff clicks `Skip` ‚Üí status `skipped`.

5. **Breaks:**  
   If Cashier 1 takes a break, they mark their counter as inactive and add a message.  
   The system skips assigning tickets to them until they return.

6. **Reports:**  
   Admins can see how many tickets were served, held, skipped, or pending by date, service, counter, and staff.

7. **Daily Reset:**  
   At midnight, ticket numbers reset for each service. Historical records stay forever for auditing.

## ‚úÖ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

This `.md` file provides a **clear, real-world-ready model and migration guide**, with a clean ERD, field definitions, constraints, and use cases ‚Äî ensuring your Kiosqueeing System is robust and audit-proof.

---

**End of file.**


- Customers pick service, get ticket.
- Staff calls ticket (`called`), customer walks to counter.
- Staff starts serving (`serving`).
- Service completes ‚Üí ticket is `completed`.
- If paused ‚Üí `held`; if skipped ‚Üí `skipped`; if cancelled ‚Üí `cancelled`.

## ‚úÖ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

This `.md` is the final, aligned, robust guide for developers building the Kiosqueeing system.
